WeMakeFuture (WMF) is Europe's largest festival on digital innovation, AI, and the future of business.

### Julia's Session: GenUI, and the Evolving Role of Designers

A major shift is on the horizon for UX & UI design. Emerging technologies like Generative UI and zeroUI will soon move interfaces beyond static designs—creating AI-driven, real-time experiences that adapt to users and their needs. From screens to voice interfaces, AR, and beyond, the way we interact with technology is about to change dramatically.

So, what does this mean for designers and businesses? While AI is poised to take on tasks like interface generation and A/B testing, designers will need to evolve—focusing on strategy, creativity, user empathy, and ethical considerations. Meanwhile, businesses must start to adopt their workflows to stay ahead of the curve.

This talk is exploring how these technologies are already being used, what’s coming next, and how companies can start integrating them across different service touchpoints. It will also dive into how designers can begin designing, testing, and validating such solutions—ensuring they enhance experiences rather than overcomplicate them.
