WIAD is the global event dedicated to the discipline of information architecture.

The 2025 theme is:
**Challenges of Change — Adapting Information Architecture for an Evolving World**

“Change is constant and rapid—just like the field of information architecture. In today’s ever-shifting landscape, we face ongoing challenges that demand innovative responses.
How can we develop new approaches to navigating our field?
By exploring new mindsets and behaviors, harnessing artificial intelligence to transform how we work, and ensuring that our discipline is built to last, we can adapt and drive continuous evolution.”

## Talk: Is Traditional Innovation Dead? How Can We Reinvent It?

The way we design and create digital experiences is changing rapidly. Traditional innovation processes—structured, linear, and slow—can no longer keep up. New tools and approaches are redefining how we generate, test, and improve ideas.

This talk explores the future of interfaces, interactions, and user data management—how we collect, store, and use data in design. AI is revolutionizing every stage of the process, from prototyping to user research, generating concepts in seconds and automating workflows. At the same time, low-code platforms are giving designers more autonomy, reducing dependence on developers, and accelerating time-to-market.

But not all change is positive. AI can speed up processes, but it can also introduce bias, reduce human creativity, and lead to excessive automation. Where should we embrace AI—and where should we tread carefully?
